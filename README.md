# ccstoolkit

A toolkit for studying the reactive phase behavior of scCO<sub>2</sub> streams and steel corrosion.

Currently there is a single module. More will be added with time.

#  Modules
- [**Corrosion maps**](ccstoolkit/corrosion_maps/)

  **Description:** Create and plot corrosion maps of steel in contact with scCO<sub>2</sub> streams.
  
  **Paper:** S. Faraji, R. M. Walker, B. Peychev, J. Sonke, R. I. Slavchov, “Surface chemistry of carbon steel in contact with CO2 streams containing impurities” Corrosion Science (2026) (Submitted for publication)
